| `/invoices/`               | GET    | List all invoices for the authenticated user                |
| `/invoice/latest/`         | GET    | Get the latest invoice for the authenticated user           |
| `/invoice/create-order/`   | POST   | Create a Razorpay order for an invoice                      |
| `/invoice/verify-payment/` | POST   | Verify Razorpay payment and update invoice status           |

---

### Notes:

- All endpoints except `/signup/` require authentication (JWT Bearer token).
- For payment-related endpoints, Razorpay integration is used.

## Celery Tasks for Subscription and Invoice Management

This project uses the following Celery tasks to automate subscription billing and invoice management:

### 1. `generate_daily_invoice`

- Runs daily to create new invoices for active subscriptions based on their billing cycle.
- Checks each active subscription to determine if today is the start of a new billing cycle.
- If so, it generates an unpaid invoice for the billing period.
- Ensures no duplicate invoices are created for the same billing cycle.

### 2. `mark_overdue_invoices`

- Runs periodically to check all unpaid invoices past their due date.
- Marks such invoices as `overdue`.
- If an invoice has been overdue for more than 7 days, it cancels the corresponding subscription.

### 3. `send_invoice_reminders` (‚úÖbonus feature)

- Sends email reminders for invoices that are overdue but whose subscriptions are still active.
- Uses an asynchronous task to send subscription overdue notification emails.
- Logs reminders sent for each overdue invoice.

---

# üòé BONUS Features

- **Actual Email Reminder be sent if invoice is unpaid.**
- **Razorpay payment gateway added. (while testing mocking the successful and failed payments)**

---

# üß™ TEST COVERAGE

#### üîê Auth All tests use JWT authentication with `Bearer` tokens.

## ‚úÖ Model Unit Tests

This test suite ensures the correct creation and behavior of core models in the system.

### ‚úîÔ∏è Covered Models:

- **MyUser**: Verifies custom user creation with username and email.
- **Plan**: Validates basic plan fields including name, price, duration, and timestamps.
- **Subscription**: Ensures subscriptions are created with correct start and end dates based on plan duration.
- **Invoice**: Tests invoice creation, due dates, and billing period calculations.

### üß™ How to Run

```bash
python manage.py test api.tests.integration_test
```

## ‚úÖ Authentication API Tests

These tests ensure that user registration and login APIs are functioning correctly.

- **User Registration**

  - Registers a user with valid credentials.
  - Handles invalid input (e.g., bad email format).

- **User Login**
  - Successfully logs in with correct credentials.
  - Fails login with incorrect password.

### üß™ How to Run

```bash
python manage.py test api.tests.api_test.auth_test
```

## ‚úÖ API Integration Tests (Subscription & Plan)

These tests ensure correct functionality of the subscription and plan-related APIs.

---

### Plan Tests

- **GET /api/plans/**
  - Returns only active plans.

---

### Subscription Tests

- **POST /api/subscribe/**

  - Allows authenticated users to subscribe to active plans.
  - Creates related `Subscription` and `Invoice`.
  - Prevents multiple active subscriptions for the same user.

- **POST /api/unsubscribe/**

  - Allows users to cancel their subscription.
  - Updates status to `cancelled`.

- **GET /api/subscriptions/**
  - Lists all subscriptions for the authenticated user (active and past).

---

### üß™ How to Run

```bash
python manage.py test api.tests.api_test.subscription_test
```

## ‚úÖ Invoice API Tests

These test cases verify the correctness and security of invoice-related endpoints, ensuring only authenticated users can access their own invoice data.

---

- **GET /api/invoices/**

  - Lists all invoices for the authenticated user.
  - Returns correct invoice count and IDs.

- **GET /api/invoice/latest/**
  - Returns the most recent invoice for the user based on `issue_date`.
  - Returns 404 with `{ "error": "No invoices found" }` if no invoices exist.

---

## ‚úÖ Razorpay Payment Integration API Tests

These test cases cover the Razorpay-related endpoints for creating orders and verifying payments against invoices.

---

- **POST /api/invoice/create-order/**

  - Creates a Razorpay order for a valid unpaid invoice.
  - Mocks Razorpay API response and updates the invoice with `razorpay_order_id`.
  - Returns `400 Bad Request` with `{ "error": "Invoice not found or already paid" }` for invalid or paid invoices.

- **POST /api/invoice/verify-payment/**

  - Marks invoice as paid if Razorpay payment verification is successful.

  - Returns 400 Bad Request with `{ "error": "Invalid signature" }` if verification fails.

### üß™ How to Run

```bash
python manage.py test api.tests.api_test.payment_test
```

---

## ‚úÖ Celery Task Functionality Tests

These test cases cover the behavior of asynchronous background tasks used for invoicing and subscription management.

---

- **`generate_daily_invoice()`**

  - Generates an invoice for active subscriptions when the current billing cycle ends.
  - Mocks the current date to simulate invoice generation after the subscription start.
  - Verifies that a new unpaid invoice is created.

- **`mark_overdue_invoices()`**

  - Updates status of invoices past their due date from `unpaid` to `overdue`.
  - Ensures correct invoice status update logic.

- **`mark_overdue_invoices()` with subscription cancellation**

  - If the invoice is overdue and a grace period has passed, the related subscription is cancelled.
  - Verifies both invoice status and subscription status updates.

- **`send_invoice_reminders()`**

  - Sends reminder emails for overdue invoices using a Celery task.
  - Mocks the email sending task to verify the reminder is triggered only for overdue invoices.

---

### üß™ How to Run

```bash
python manage.py test api.tests.celery_test
```
